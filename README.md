# Duck-Life
Final project in CSCI 1300. This is a text based game that is supposed to immitate the Duck Life games. In this game you start out naming and picking out your duck. The goal is for your duck to be the best racer. You complete this by leveling up your ducks skills, buying things at the store to upgrade your duck, and finally winning all the races your duck competes in order to win the duck championship! Good luck!
